    "text": "Filtering cells that have lost transcriptomic information during isolation protocols, referred to here as “damaged cells”, is a fundamental quality control task for single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis. However, unlike other aspects of cell quality control, such as doublet and empty droplet removal, how to best filter damaged cells from single cell data has not been thoroughly explored.\nSearching online tutorials, forums, and published articles will bring you to the same conclusion: filter cells that express a high proportion of mitochondrial genes. This is because damaged cells are understood to have impaired membranes where cytoplasmic RNA content has escaped. It is for the same reason that the number of unique transcripts and UMIs per cell are also recommended metrics for identifying damaged cells.\nMore recently, the proportion of unspliced RNA, targeting transcripts that remain intact in the nucleus in the event of damage, and ribosomal RNA, targeting those that do not, are offered as damaged cell quality control metrics. Extending from this, the expression of the nuclear-located long non-coding RNA, MALAT1, has also been suggested as a potential metric for identifying damaged cells.\nThe problem for a user then arises in two forms: 1. Which cell quality controls metrics should I use and 2. According to what outlier detection framework should I perform filtering\nDamaged cell detection tools provide their own solutions to the problems. However, the relative effectiveness of these tools, and of manual methods, is yet to be systematically determined. Our goal with this benchmark is to provide an objective answer to the question of how to best filter damaged cells in single cell data. Providing users with information on the characteristics of each available strategy, we aim for comprehensive, robust action towards addressing this quality control task."
